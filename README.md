# Portfolio_Risk_Management

Modern investing platforms provide users with numbers, charts, and percentages - but they rarely explain what those numbers mean. Investors are left with a portfolio balance and a return percentage, without understanding the risks they are exposed to, the consequences of their decisions, or how their portfolio might behave under adverse conditions.

This project introduces an AI-assisted portfolio risk interpretation platform designed to bridge that gap.

Rather than executing trades or providing investment recommendations, the platform focuses on understanding how and why a portfolio behaves the way it does. By analyzing user-provided portfolio data alongside historical market information, the system reconstructs the story behind each investment decision - highlighting risk exposure, behavioral patterns, and potential vulnerabilities that are often invisible in traditional brokerage tools.

The platform operates as an external intelligence layer. Users can import their portfolio data through a secure, user-initiated process and explore their investments in a separate analytical environment. This separation ensures that the system remains focused on education, transparency, and decision analysis rather than execution.

Key capabilities include:

- Portfolio-level risk assessment, including volatility, drawdowns, and concentration risk

- Transaction-level analysis that contextualizes past decisions within historical market conditions

- Interactive scenario replays that visually demonstrate how portfolios would have behaved during major market events

- Counterfactual simulations that allow users to explore alternative strategies and their outcomes

- Natural-language explanations that translate complex financial metrics into intuitive insights

By combining quantitative risk models with clear visualizations and AI-assisted explanations, the platform aims to make investing more understandable and interesting, especially for new investors.

The ultimate goal is to help users move beyond surface-level performance metrics and develop a deeper intuition for risk, uncertainty, and long-term decision-making.
